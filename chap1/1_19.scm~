;; Fast fibonacci
;;
;; The n-th fibonacci number can be obtained by applying
;; a -> a + b, b -> a, n times, starting with a = 1, b = 0.
;; The final values of a and b will be the (n + 1)-th and
;; n-th fibonacci numbers respectively.
;;
;; This is a special case of the transformation T_{pq}, a ->
;; bq + aq + ap, b -> bp + aq. Applying this transformation
;; twice we get, a -> bq' + aq' + ap', b-> bp' + aq', where
;; p' = p^2 + q^2, and q' = q^2 + 2pq. This is similar to
;; doing the T_{p'q'} transformation once. And in doing so
;; we can find the n-th fibonacci number in logarithmic
;; number of steps as we will be taking advantage of
;; successive squaring.
