Fast iterative exponentiation

We have to devise an iterative algorithm that uses
successive squaring to compute the n-th power of a number b.

The idea is to have two state variables a, and count, in
addition to n and b, such that ab^n remains unchanged at
each step. Since (b^(n/2))^2 = (b^2)^(n/2). For even n,
starting with a = 1, and count = n/2, the transformation
will be a -> ab^2 and count -> count-1. The process will stop
when count=0. And the anwer will be given by the then value
of a. This can be easily generalized to odd n as, b^n =
b*b^(n-1).

```scheme
(define (fast-iter-exp b n)
  (define (even? x) (= (remainder n 2) 0))
  (define (iter a count)
    (cond ((= count 0) a)
	  (else (iter (* a (square b)) (- count 1)))))
  (cond ((even? n) (iter 1 (/ n 2)))
	(else (* b (iter 1 (/ (- n 1) 2))))))
```
