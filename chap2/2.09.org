Let the numbers be \( x = x_0 ± Δx \), and \( y = y_0 ± Δy \), where the $Δ$
quantities are the widths representating th uncertainty of the numbers.
Then,
$$ x + y = x_0 ± Δx + y_0 ± Δy = (x_0 + y_0) ± (Δx + Δy). $$
Thus, the width of the sum is the sum of the widths. Similarly
$$ x - y = (x_0 - y_0) ± (Δx - Δy). $$

Multiplication and division are somewhat different.
$$ xy = (x_0 ± Δx)(y_0 ± Δy) = (x_0y_0 + ΔxΔy) ± (x_0Δy + Δxy_0). $$
Not only do the width of the product depend on the central values of $x$ and
$y$, but interestingly the central value of the product depend on the widths
$Δx$ and $Δy$.
Division is slightly more complicated and we need to use the Taylor expansion of
$1/(1-z)$ for $|z|<1$.
$$ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x_0 ± Δx}{y_0 ± Δy} 
= \frac{x_0}{y_0} \frac{1 ± \frac{Δx}{x_0}}{1 ± \frac{Δy}{y_0}} 
= \frac{x_0}{y_0} \left( 1 ± \frac{Δx}{x_0} \right) \left( 1 ∓ \frac{Δy}{y_0}
\right)
= \left( \frac{x_0}{y_0} - \frac{ΔxΔy}{y_0^2} \right) ± \left( \frac{Δx}{x_0} -
\frac{Δy}{y_0} \right). $$
